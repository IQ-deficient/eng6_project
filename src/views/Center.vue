                            Podgorica, as the capital, is located in the heart of Montenegro, due to the mostly nice
                            weather throughout the year, it is very attractive and appealing to people. One of the
                            places to be singled out is the hill Gorica, where people from Podgorica can find peace and
                            quiet, the right place for recreation, for walking, as well as for conversation. Also, as we
                            said that Montenegro is rich in rivers, the rivers Morača and Ribnica flow through the city,
                            while in the vicinity flow Zeta, Cijevna, and Sitnica. Not far from Podgorica, in Tuzi,

                            as the most visited Orthodox shrine in all of Europe. Located in a large rock called
                            "Ostroška greda", at 900 meters above sea level in the municipality of Danilovgrad, the
                            monastery Ostrog is often described as a true masterpiece of nature and humanity. It was
                            founded in the 17th century as part of Saint Basil of Ostrog, who was buried inside the
                            monastery and is believed to have miraculous powers for many pilgrims who come to visit the
                            Ostrog monastery. Every year, more than a few hundred thousand people from all over the
                            world, of various nationalities and religions visit. During the summer period alone, more
                            than 300,000 visitors come to find their peace and salvation in an authentically beautiful
                            monastery.

                            Also, we said that the central part is rich in national parks, and it includes the Lovcen
                            National Park and Skadar Lake National Park. Lovcen National Park encompasses the central
                            and highest part of the mountain of the same name, which for Montenegrins is a symbol of
                            freedom and a "holy altar". On Jezerski vrh, in the realm of lightning and thunder, the
                            mausoleum of Peter the Second Petrovic Njegos, bishop, poet and ruler of Montenegro
                            (1813-1851), was erected. Climbing to the mausoleum is the crown of a visit to the National
                            Park, and this imposing building can be reached by road from Cetinje, about 20 km long, and
                            then by overcoming 461 steps to the top of the mountain. Lovcen is known for its lookouts
                            from all sides - towards the sea, Lake Skadar or the high mountains in the north. Everywhere
                            you look you will experience a unique and unforgettable visual impression. The points on
                            Lovcen from which the Montenegrin beauties can be seen are numerous: Jezerski vrh,
                            Stirovnik, the old road from Krstac to the winter resort of Ivanova korita; from the
                            Austrian strategic roads that led to the tops of the mountains, from the Kotor serpentines -
                            an ancient road that winds like a snake to the sides of Lovcen. It is a kind of design and
                            construction phenomenon. On the steep slope of Lovcen, exposed to the Bay of Boka -
                            serpentines are a unique experience.

                            Lake Skadar is the largest freshwater area in the Balkans. Due to its geographical position
                            and the characteristics of the sub-Mediterranean climate, it is one of the most important
                            habitats of wetland birds in Europe in winter. About 280 species of birds live on the lake,
                            and a rare specimen of the curly pelican is a trademark of the National Park. On the shores
                            of the lake are two small towns - the old urban core, specific architecture, places of great
                            importance for the development of the Montenegrin state: Virpazar and River Crnojevic.
                            Today, both settlements are recognizable by the restaurants that serve traditional
                            specialties. The southern hinterland of the lake (Crmnica) is known for the best wine in
                            Montenegro, which in combination with smoked lake carp will satisfy even the most picky
                            lovers of good food. The lake also has a number of extraordinary beaches, among which those
                            in the village of Murici stand out, no less attractive than the coastal beaches.
